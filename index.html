I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air. In west Philadelphia, born and raised, on the playground was where I spent most of my days, chillin' out... maxin'... relaxin' all cool... and all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school... when a couple of guys who were up to no good started making trouble in my neighborhood. I got in one little fight and my mom got scared. She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'. I begged and pleaded with her day after day, but she packed my suit case and sent me on my way. She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket. I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'. First class, yo, this is bad. Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass. Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like? Hmm... this might be alright. But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that - is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat? I don't think so. I'll see when I get there. I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air. Well, the plane landed and when I came out, there was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out. I ain't trying to get arrested yet. I just got here. I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared. I whistled for a cab and when it came near, the license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror. If anything, I could say that this cab was rare, but, I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, holmes to Bel Air!' I pulled up to the house about seven or eight and I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo holmes - smell ya later.' I looked at my kingdom - I was finally there - to sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air.\n",
